# Micro.Recommends

A Hugo shortcode to show Micro.blog recommendations in an html table format instead of list. Include `{{< recommends >}}` in a blog post or standalone page. This plugin was forked from Manton's original [plugin-blogroll-shortcode](https://github.com/microdotblog/plugin-blogroll-shortcode/).

To show a recommendation's "hostname" and/or "about" in their own columns, include short code parameters like this: `{{< recommends name="Favorite Feeds" show_hostname=true show_about=true >}}`
